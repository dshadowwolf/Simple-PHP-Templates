This code is currently in a non-usable state, but can easily be
reverted to usability by replacing the database interactions. When I
halted work on this code because of other things consuming my time
there were plans to move this from a mass of files in directories to
a database.

Note: There is an XSS bug in the handling of error pages - nominally
the HTTP 404 error - where input is taken directly from the URL and
inserted into a page without any escaping or validation. The
correction of this is left, currently, as an exercize for the end-user
as I still do not have time to work solely on this code.

See file "INSTRUCTIONS" for instructions on how to implement this template 
system in its base form. As work progresses on retargeting this system it 
will change.

Oh, and thanks for grabbing this and trying to use it :)

And yes, it is GPLv2 and *ONLY* GPLv2.
